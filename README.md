Provides a function to perform a union on 2 triangles. Intended for use with cone-tracing algorithms.


Provides a datastructure for storing triangles based on how far they are from a light source. (Not Implemented Yet)

The datastructure is capable of performing the following queries:
  1. for a point, get the closest triangle
  2. get the visible surface area
